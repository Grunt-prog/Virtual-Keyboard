**Hand-Tracking-Module**

A hand tracking module is a software component or algorithm that is designed to detect and track human hands in images or video streams. It utilizes computer vision techniques to identify the positions and movements of hands, enabling applications to interact with gestures or perform hand-related tasks.


**Virtual Keyboard**

This keyboard consists of three rows of alphabets arranged in a layout similar to a physical keyboard:

First Row: "Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P"

Second Row: "A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", ";"

Third Row: "Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", ",", ".", "/"


The virtual keyboard developed using OpenCV and a hand tracking module offers users the ability to input text by using their hands instead of a physical keyboard. The keyboard layout consists of three rows of alphabets, with the first row containing "Q" to "P", the second row containing "A" to "L" along with a semicolon, and the third row containing "Z" to "/" (comma, period, and forward slash). The system utilizes computer vision techniques to track the user's hand movements through the camera input. It starts by detecting the presence of hands and then proceeds to track their positions and movements over time. By analyzing the hand positions, the system determines which key on the virtual keyboard the user's hand is hovering over or selecting. The selected key is recognized as the corresponding alphabet, allowing the user to input text. This innovative approach provides an alternative and interactive way for users to input text, enhancing the overall user experience.
